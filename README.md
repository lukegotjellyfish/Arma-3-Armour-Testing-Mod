# Arma-3-Armour-Testing-Mod
 Requires RHSUSAF (rhsusf_weapons) for adding M107 magazines with incremented armour penetration
 Use DevBranch ([+ my damage tracker script](https://github.com/lukegotjellyfish/Arma-Class-Exporter/blob/master/Script/OtherScripts/vehicle%20damage%20tracker.sqf)) for acces to diag_toggle "shots" to actually get useful information when using these for testing.
