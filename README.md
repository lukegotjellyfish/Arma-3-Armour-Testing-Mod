# Arma-3-Armour-Testing-Mod
Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2385173498

 Requires RHSUSAF (rhsusf_weapons) for adding M107 magazines with incremented armour penetration<br>
 Use DevBranch ([+ my damage tracker script](https://github.com/lukegotjellyfish/Arma-Class-Exporter/blob/master/Script/OtherScripts/vehicle%20damage%20tracker.sqf)) for access to diag_toggle "shots" to actually get useful information when using these for testing.

# To use:
Put it in a folder somewhere, open the Arma launcher and goto the MODS section, click "Local Mod" at the top and select the folder you put the shit in and then load it as a mod
